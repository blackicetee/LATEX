\chapter{Text elements}
\label{cha:text-elements}

In this chapter, some textual elements are shown, like figures, tables,
lists, equations, etc. Also, bananas. At this point, to try it out, I will
cite~\cite{a} different articles~\cite{a,b,c}, as can be read in Ref.~\cite{b}.

\section{Math}
\label{sec:math}

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with
the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted
parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has
no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One
day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided
to leave for the far World of Grammar.
\begin{align}
    g(\varepsilon) &= \frac{N}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma}
    \eexp{-\frac{\varepsilon^2}{2\sigma^2}}
    \eeexp{-\frac{\varepsilon^2}{2\sigma^2}}
    \eeeexp{-\frac{\varepsilon^2}{2\sigma^2}} 
    \label{eq:eq1}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \sum\limits^b_{n=a}x_n = \int\limits^{2\pi}_0 r\cdot \cos(\theta) \mathrm d \theta
\end{align}


\section{References}
\label{sec:refs}

The cleveref package is extremely useful to simplify references. In
\cref{sec:units} occurs the \cref{fig:bla} and the \cref{eq:eq1}?

\section{Units}
\label{sec:units}

Let us try out \emph{siunitx}: 

\num{12345,67890} \\
\num{1+-2i}\\
\num{.3e45} \\
\num{1.654 x 2.34 x 3.430}\\
\si{kg.m.s^{-1}} \\
\si{\kilogram\metre\per\second} \\
\si[per-mode=symbol]
{\kilogram\metre\per\second} \\
\si[per-mode=symbol]
{\kilogram\metre\per\ampere\per\second}

    eat a lot of spinage and became rather tall and my mother was a
